# 🇵🇭 Setup Guide - Working from Philippines

## 🌐 You Can Access the Live Website from Philippines!

The website your boss created is hosted on **Vercel**, which means:
- ✅ **You can access it from anywhere** - Philippines, USA, anywhere!
- ✅ **Internet connection is all you need**
- ✅ **No location restrictions**

---

## 🎯 Two Ways to Use the System

### Option 1: View the Live Website (What Users See)

**Ask your boss for the website URL**, it will look like:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- OR a custom domain like `https://yourcompany.com`

**Just open it in your browser from the Philippines!**

---

### Option 2: Develop Locally (What We Set Up)

**This is what we just did!** You can:
- ✅ Work on the code on your computer
- ✅ Test changes before deploying
- ✅ Develop even without internet (after initial setup)
- ✅ Work at `http://localhost:3000`

**Location doesn't matter** - local development works the same in Philippines or USA!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start: See the Live Site

### Step 1: Get the Live URL from Your Boss

Ask your boss:
> "What's the website URL? I want to see the live version from the Philippines."

They'll give you something like:
- `https://nextjs-auth-roles.vercel.app`
- OR their custom domain

### Step 2: Open It in Your Browser

1. Open any web browser
2. Type the URL your boss gave you
3. Press Enter
4. **You'll see the live website!** 🎉

## 💻 Quick Start: Develop Locally

### Step 1: Start Local Server

I already started it for you! But if you need to start it again:

1. In Cursor, press `Ctrl + ~` to open terminal
2. Type: `npm run dev`
3. Press Enter

### Step 2: Open Local Version

1. Open browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
3. **You'll see your local development version!**

- **What it is:** The actual website users see
- **Location:** Hosted on Vercel servers (USA)
- **Access:** From anywhere with internet (Philippines, USA, etc.)
- **Changes:** Only updates when you deploy new code

### Local Development
- **URL:** `http://localhost:3000` (on your computer)
