Hi [Boss Name],

I'm setting up the project locally to continue development and improvements. Could you please provide the following credentials so I can connect to the database and test the system:

1. SUPABASE CREDENTIALS:
   - Supabase Project URL (looks like https://xxxxx.supabase.co)
   - Supabase Service Role Key
   - Database Connection Strings:
     * DATABASE_URL (Transaction Pooler connection)
     * DIRECT_URL (Direct connection for migrations)

2. OPTIONAL BUT HELPFUL:
   - Git repository URL (if the project is on GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
   - Vercel project access (or exported environment variables)

WHERE TO FIND THESE IN SUPABASE:
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings → Database → Copy connection strings
4. Settings → API → Copy Project URL and service_role key

Once I have these, I'll be able to:
- Connect to the database locally
- Test features before deploying
- Make improvements safely
- Push changes to preview deployments for testing

Thanks!
