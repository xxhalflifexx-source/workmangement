# 📋 Quick Reference: When to Push to GitHub

## ⚠️ Always Check This File After I Make Changes!

I will update `PUSH_TO_GITHUB_SUMMARY.md` every time I make changes that need to be pushed.

## 🎯 Quick Steps

1. **Check `PUSH_TO_GITHUB_SUMMARY.md`** - See what changed
2. **Open GitHub Desktop** - See the changes
3. **Commit with message** - Use the message from the summary
4. **Push to GitHub** - Click "Push origin"
5. **Wait for Vercel** - 2-3 minutes for rebuild

## 📝 Standard Commit Messages

I'll provide commit messages in the summary, but here are common ones:

- `Fix TypeScript error in [file]`
- `Add [feature] to [page]`
- `Update database schema for [reason]`
- `Fix [issue] on [page]`
