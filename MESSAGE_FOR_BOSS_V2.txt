Hi [Boss Name],

I'm setting up the project locally to continue development. Since you didn't write the code, I need access to the dashboards where the credentials are stored.

Could you please provide access to one of these:

OPTION 1 (Easiest): Vercel Dashboard
- Go to https://vercel.com
- Give me access to the project, OR
- Export the environment variables and send them to me
- This has all the credentials in one place

OPTION 2: Supabase Dashboard  
- Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Give me access to the project
- I can get the database credentials from there

OPTION 3: Export from Vercel
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables
- Export/download the variables
- Send me the file

I need these to connect to the database and test the system locally. Once I have them, I can start making improvements right away.

Thanks!
